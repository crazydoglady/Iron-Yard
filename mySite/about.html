       <p><h1>Hi! </h1>

       <p>Currently, Mount Pleasant, SC is home. I was raised in the Midwest, spent a few years in the Northeast before migrating to a warmer, coastal climate.</p>

       <p>I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a degree in Political Science and ultimately found myself working in Human Resources and Recruiting. Currently ,I am working towards a second career in web development.
       When I'm not working or learning,  I have a wide range of hobbies that include trivia,  visual arts, cooking, running the occasional half marathon.</p>

       <p>If you have spent any amount of time talking to me, you have probably heard about my dogs, so it would be unthinkable to leave them out of my website!
       They are my copilots and love a good adventure, so I take them with me everywhere I can. </p>
       <p>Ember was my first greyhound, adopted in 2011 when we lived in Philly. She raced under the name "Astarroyalheaven", but flunked out of the track after only 9 races since she never won, but we don't tell the neighborhood
        rabbits about that. Ember's retirement includes work as a registered Therapy Dog, visiting medical and assisted living facilities to visit with patients and residents. She will do almost anything for baby carrots and string cheese.

      <p>Billie joined the pack in 2013. She raced under the name "Hallo Mrs Leen" and ran 113 races before she was injured on the track and forced into retirement.
      She still loves to run and has made her own track in the backyard. Billie is an expert-level couch hog and countersurfer. She also does a pretty impressive kangaroo impression.</p>
